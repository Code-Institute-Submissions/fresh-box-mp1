FreshBox is aimed at young business professionals who don't have the time to shop for every meal
due to work, gym and social life commitments. They want to increase their orders through simplistic and intuitive

website.

#### User 1:

Discovered this website using a search engine, has heard of similar companies providing a similar service.
I want to see what types of boxes are on offer.

This will be achieved by adding the box contents to the landing page. It will show the boxes on offer and that the
first box is free.

#### User 2:

Returning user, who hasn't already ordered. I want to order my first box.

This can be done through the landing page as well.

#### User 3:

Has already ordered, but wishes to explore what other types of boxes are available to order.

The other box types can be found in the the Recipes?? tab, likely to be called something else.
