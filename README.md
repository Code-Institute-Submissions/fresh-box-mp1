## FreshBox

FreshBox are environmentally conscious and only use distrubuters who use sustainable farming methods. Reduced use of carbon emissions
througout the process by using local farms and produce centers. Food is fresh when delivered and never frozen. Also work
with top end restaurants in the UK.

## UX

FreshBox is aimed at young business professionals who don't have the time to shop for every meal
due to work, gym and social life commitments. They want to increase their orders through simplistic and intuitive
design, making it easy for the user to order their first trial box without having to search for it and the
website.

### Wireframe design

Designs have been added to show the initial ideas and designs on the FreshBox website. It includes notes on each page to explain why design decisions where made. Some design choices were not kept or altered as they were not best practice when considering user eperience.

#### User 1:

> Discovered this website using a search engine, has heard of similar companies providing a similar service.
> I want to see what types of boxes are on offer and I want to learn about the business.

> This will be achieved by adding the box contents to the landing page. It will show the boxes on offer and that the
> first box is free.

#### User 2:

> Returning user who hasn't already ordered. I want to order my first box.

> This can be done through the landing page as well.

#### User 3:

> Has already ordered, but wishes to explore what other types of boxes are available to order.

> The other box types can be found on the boxâ€™s webpage, as well as sort description on the index page.
